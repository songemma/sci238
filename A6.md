**Question (Problem S2.50):**  
A clever student, after learning about the theory of relativity, decides to apply his knowledge in order to prolong his life. He decides to spend the rest of his life in a car, traveling around the freeways at 55 miles per hour (89 km/hr).  
Suppose he drives for a period of time during which 70 years pass in his house. How much time will pass in the car?

$$  
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta\tau  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}  
$$  
$$  
v = 89\ \text{km/hr} = 24.7 m/s  
$$  
$$  
\Delta t = 70\ yr = 2.21\times10^9\ s  
$$  
$$  
\gamma \approx 1 + \frac12\frac{v^2}{c^2}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = 1 + 3.4\times10^{-15}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = \frac{2.21\times10^9}{1 + 3.4\times10^{-15}}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = 2.21\times10^9\ s  
$$

$2.2\times10^9\ s$

**Question:**  
An even more clever student decides to prolong her life by cruising around the solar neighborhood at 0.89c. How much time passes on her spacecraft during 70 years on Earth?

$$  
\Delta\tau = \frac{70}{\gamma}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.89^2}}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = 2.19  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = \frac{70}{2.19}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = 31.9\ yr  
$$

31.9 yr

**Question:**  
Will she feel as if her life span has been extended?

No.

---

**Question:**  
Explain.

Her clock and biological processes slow by the same factor relative to Earth, so she experiences normal aging.

**Question (Twin Scenario):**  
Your twin travels at 0.99c. You age 20 years. How old is she upon return?

$$  
\Delta\tau = \frac{20}{\gamma}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99^2}}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = 7.09  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = \frac{20}{7.09}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta\tau = 2.82\ yr  
$$  
$$  
\text{age} = 25 + 2.82 = 27.8\ yr  
$$

≈ 28 yr

**Question (Problem S2.54):**  
The ISS orbits Earth at about 30,000 km/hr. While 1 hour passes on Earth, how much less time passes on the Station?

$$  
\Delta t - \Delta\tau = \Delta t(1 - \gamma^{-1})  
$$  
$$  
\gamma \approx 1 + \frac12\frac{v^2}{c^2}  
$$  
$$  
v = \frac{30000}{3600} = 8.33\times10^3\ m/s  
$$  
$$  
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 7.7\times10^{-10}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = 1 + 3.9\times10^{-10}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta t = 3600\ s  
$$  
$$  
\Delta t - \Delta\tau = 3600(3.9\times10^{-10})  
$$  
$$  
\Delta t - \Delta\tau = 1.4\times10^{-6}\ s  
$$

$1.39\times10^{-6}\ s$

**Question (Problem S2.52 Part A):**  
A spaceship has a rest mass of 700,000 tons. What is its mass at 0.5c?

$$  
m = \gamma m_0  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}}  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = 1.155  
$$  
$$  
m = 1.155(700000)  
$$  
$$  
m = 8.08\times10^5\ \text{tons}  
$$

$8.08\times10^5$ tons

**Question (Problem S2.52 Part B):**  
A fly has a mass of 1 g at rest. How fast must it travel to have a mass of 3000 kg?

$$  
\gamma = \frac{3000}{0.001} = 3.0\times10^6  
$$  
$$  
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}  
$$  
$$  
\frac{1}{\gamma} = 3.3\times10^{-7}  
$$  
$$  
1 - \beta^2 = (3.3\times10^{-7})^2 = 1.1\times10^{-13}  
$$  
$$  
\beta \approx 1  
$$

very close to the speed of light

**Question (Problem S2.55):**  
A pitcher throws a baseball at 0.80c inside a spacecraft traveling at 0.95c. How fast does Earth measure the baseball?

$$  
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v/c^2}  
$$  
$$  
u = \frac{0.80c + 0.95c}{1 + (0.80)(0.95)}  
$$  
$$  
u = \frac{1.75c}{1.76}  
$$  
$$  
u = 0.9943c  
$$

$0.9943c$
