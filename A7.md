**Assume there are 500 billion stars in the galaxy.**  
**Express your answer using two significant figures.**

$$  
N_{\text{stars}} = 5.0 \times 10^{11}  
$$  
$$  
N_{\text{civ}} = 1.7 \times 10^4  
$$  
$$  
N_A = \frac{N_{\text{stars}}}{N_{\text{civ}}} = \frac{5.0 \times 10^{11}}{1.7 \times 10^4} = 2.94 \times 10^7

## **Problem 24.56**

**Suppose we have a spaceship about the size of a typical ocean cruise ship today, which means it has a mass of about 90 million kilograms, and we want to accelerate the ship to a speed of 9% of the speed of light.**

---

**Part A**

**How much energy would be required?**  
**(Hint: You can find the answer simply by calculating the kinetic energy of the ship when it reaches its cruising speed; because 9% of the speed of light is still small compared to the speed of light, you can use this formula:**

$$  
\text{kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2  
$$

**Express your answer to two significant figures and include the appropriate units.**

$$  
m = 9.0 \times 10^7 , \text{kg}  
$$  
$$  
v = 0.09c = 0.09 \times 3.0 \times 10^8 = 2.7 \times 10^7 , \text{m/s}  
$$  
$$  
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (9.0 \times 10^7) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^7)^2  
= 0.5 \cdot 9.0 \times 10^7 \cdot 7.29 \times 10^{14}  
= 3.28 \times 10^{22}  
$$  
$$  
\boxed{3.3 \times 10^{22} , \text{J}}  
$$

---

**Part B**

**How does your answer compare to total world energy use at present, which is about $5 \times 10^{22}$ joules per year?**  
**Express your answer as a percentage using two significant figures.**

$$  
\text{Percent} = \left( \frac{3.3 \times 10^{22}}{5.0 \times 10^{22}} \right) \times 100 = 66%  
$$  
$$  
\boxed{66\%}  
$$

---

**Part C**

**The typical cost of energy today is roughly 5 cents per 1 million joules. Using this price, how much would it cost to generate the energy needed by this spaceship?**  
**Express your answer in dollars to two significant figures.**

$$  
\text{Cost per J} = \frac{0.05}{10^6} = 5.0 \times 10^{-8} , \text{dollars per J}  
$$  
$$  
\text{Cost} = 3.3 \times 10^{22} \cdot 5.0 \times 10^{-8} = 1.65 \times 10^{15}  
$$  
$$  
\boxed{1.6 \times 10^{15} , \text{dollars}}  
$$

$$  
$$  
\tan(27^\circ) = 0.5095  
$$  
$$  
v = \frac{1}{0.5095} = 1.963 , \text{light-seconds/s}  
$$  
$$  
v = 1.963 \cdot 3.0 \times 10^8 = 5.89 \times 10^8

## **Problem S3.58**

**The Andromeda Galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away. Suppose you had a spaceship that could constantly accelerate at**  
$$a = 1.6g$$  
**As long as the ship is gone from Earth for many years, the amount of time that passes on the spaceship during the trip is approximately:**

$$  
t_{\text{ship}} = \frac{2c}{a} \ln\left( \frac{a \cdot D}{c^2} \right)  
$$

**where** $D$ **is the distance to the destination and** $\ln$ **stands for the natural logarithm (which you can calculate with the "ln" key on most scientific calculators). If** $D$ **is in meters,**

D = 2.5 \times 10^6 \cdot 9.461 \times 10^{15} = 2.365 \times 10^{22} , \text{m}  
$$  
$$  
a = 1.6 \cdot 9.8 = 15.68 , \text{m/s}^2  
$$  
$$  
t_{\text{ship}} = \frac{2 \cdot 3.0 \times 10^8}{15.68} \cdot \ln\left( \frac{15.68 \cdot 2.365 \times 10^{22}}{(3.0 \times 10^8)^2} \right)  
$$  
$$

## **Problem S3.59**

**For a relatively weak gravitational field, such as that of a planet or an ordinary star, the following formula tells us the fractional amount of gravitational time dilation at a distance $r$ from the center of an object of mass $M_{\text{object}}$:**

$$  
\frac{1}{c^2} \times \left( \frac{GM_{\text{object}}}{r} \right)  
$$

$(G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} , \text{m}^3/\text{(kg} \cdot \text{s}^2); \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s})$  
For example, while 1 hour passes in deep space far from the object, the amount of time that passes at a distance $r$ is 1 hour minus 1 hour multiplied by the factor above.  
(This formula does _not_ apply to strong gravitational fields, like those near black holes.)

---

**Part A**

**Calculate the amount of time that passes on Earth's surface while 3.0 hour passes in deep space.**  
**Express your answer in seconds to three significant figures.**

$$  
T = 3.0 , \text{hr} = 10{,}800 , \text{s}  
$$  
$$  
\Delta T = 10{,}800 \cdot \left( \frac{GM}{rc^2} \right)  
= 10{,}800 \cdot \left( \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 5.97 \times 10^{24}}{6.37 \times 10^6 \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8)^2} \right)  
$$  
$$  
= 10{,}800 \cdot (6.94 \times 10^{-10}) = 7.49 \times 10^{-6} , \text{s}  
$$  
$$  
T_{\text{on Earth}} = 10{,}800 - 7.49 \times 10^{-6}  
$$  
$$  
\boxed{T_{\text{on Earth}} = 3.0 , \text{hr} - 7.49 \times 10^{-6} , \text{s}}  
$$

$$  
$$  
= 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \cdot \frac{8.28 \times 10^{-61}}{1.0 \times 10^{-20}} = 5.52 \times 10^{-51}

$$

---

$$  
\boxed{4.2 \times 10^{42}}  
$$
